      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p class="emphasis">Hi, my name is Daniel Beadle. I'm an interactive designer, writer, and digital artist. I love creating meaningful and memorable experiences.</p>

      <p>A little background: I’ve been drawing for as long as I can remember, and I’ve always been interested in sequential artwork and visual storytelling. I have a huge passion for creative writing, and have written dozens of interconnected stories over the years. I turned one such story into a comic strip, which I published in my college newspaper, and later online.</p>

      <p>Professionally, I'm an interactive designer. My role has evolved over the years, but the core of what I do is creating intuitive, meaningful, and visually appealing web experiences for users. My talents also extend to branding, marketing, and refining processes, and I’ve been known to consult on more complex projects from time to time. I take great pleasure in being around other creative and intelligent people, and in finding unexpected ways to solve problems.</p>

      <p>But that's enough about me. What's up with you?</p>
